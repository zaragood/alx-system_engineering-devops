0x0F Load Balancer
Overview
The 0x0F Load Balancer is a simple and efficient load balancing solution designed to distribute incoming network traffic across multiple servers to ensure optimal resource utilization and prevent any single server from being overwhelmed. This project is implemented using modern technologies and follows best practices in load balancing.

Features
Load Distribution: The load balancer intelligently distributes incoming traffic among a pool of backend servers, ensuring even load distribution and preventing any single server from becoming a bottleneck.

Fault Tolerance: The load balancer enhances system reliability by redirecting traffic away from failed or unhealthy servers, minimizing downtime and providing a seamless user experience.

Scalability: Easily scale your infrastructure by adding or removing servers from the backend pool without disrupting ongoing operations. The load balancer dynamically adjusts to changes in server availability.

Health Monitoring: Periodic health checks are performed on backend servers to identify any issues promptly. Unhealthy servers are automatically taken out of rotation until they recover, ensuring consistent performance.
