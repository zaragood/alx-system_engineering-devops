## Overview

Web infrastructure design is a critical aspect of modern web development. It involves planning, designing, and implementing the hardware, software, network, and storage components required to support web applications and services. Understanding web infrastructure design is crucial for building reliable, high-performance, and secure web systems.

## Topics Covered

This repository covers various topics related to web infrastructure design, including:

- **Load Balancing**: Distributing network traffic across multiple servers to ensure no single server is overwhelmed.
- **High Availability**: Ensuring systems are operational and accessible, minimizing downtime and service interruptions.
- **Scalability**: Designing systems that can handle increased load by adding resources or nodes.
- **Security**: Implementing measures to protect against threats and unauthorized access.
- **Caching**: Storing frequently accessed data in memory for faster retrieval.
- **Content Delivery Networks (CDNs)**: Distributing content to servers geographically closer to users for faster loading times.
